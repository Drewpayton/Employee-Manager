# Install

_You will need MySQL and Node.js installed for this to work_

[Click Here](https://github.com/Drewpayton/Employee-Manager) to access the github repo

After you clone the repo you'll open the terminal and run the following:

`npm i`

The line above will install all your dependencies, next you will log into your MySQL from the terminal and use the two lines below:

`SOURCE db/schema.sql` and then `SOURCE db/seeds.sql`

After you run those you can start the program with the following command:

`node index.js`
